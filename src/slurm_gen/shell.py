# unavailable"); ENOMEM is the transient out-of-memory-at-fork variant. Permanent
# errors (e.g. ENOENT "command not found") are NOT in this set and propagate
# immediately. Retrying is safe because these failures happen at fork(), before
# exec(), so the command never ran (no half-submitted sbatch to duplicate).

# `squeue` hang indefinitely, and with no timeout that hangs the whole monitor
# in a way nothing can see: the process is alive, the poll never returns, and no
# log line is written. Generous enough for a loaded controller, short enough
# that the loop's own error handling gets a turn.

    Retries only on transient failures to *spawn* the child process (fork()
    failing with EAGAIN/ENOMEM on a saturated login node), with exponential
    backoff. A non-zero exit (``check``), timeout, or permanent OSError (e.g.
    command not found) is not retried and propagates normally.

    Args:
        argv: Command and arguments to run.
        check: Raise CalledProcessError on non-zero exit.
        capture_output: Capture stdout and stderr.
        text: Return text instead of bytes.
        timeout: Timeout in seconds; ``None`` waits forever (rarely what you
            want -- see DEFAULT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_S).
        max_spawn_retries: Max retries when fork() fails transiently.
        spawn_retry_backoff: Base seconds for exponential backoff between retries.

        CompletedProcess with stdout, stderr, and returncode.
