    Used by two fields on :class:`SlurmConfig` with very different status:

    ``srun_args``  RENDERED into the ``{srun_opts}`` template placeholder by
                   ``build_srun_args``. Because it is a mapping, Hydra MERGES it
                   key-by-key across the defaults list, so a cluster group and an
                   experiment can each contribute flags without clobbering each
                   other. Prefer this.
    ``srun``       LEGACY AND DEAD. No template has a placeholder for it and
                   nothing reads it, so every flag in an ``srun:`` block (``wait:
                   60``, ``exclusive: true``, ``kill_on_bad_exit: 1``, ...) has
                   never reached srun. It is left unrendered on purpose:
                   switching it on would silently change every cluster at once,
                   and some of those values are actively harmful (``--wait=60``
                   kills the step 60 s after the first task exits). Migrate a
                   block to ``srun_args`` deliberately, one cluster at a time.

        log_dir: Directory for SLURM log files.
        name: Optional job name for client tracking.
        script_path: Optional path to the job script for submission.
        log_path: Optional path to the log file for submission.
        array: Whether to use job arrays.
        launcher_cmd: Additional launcher command.
        srun_opts: Additional srun options, as one verbatim string. A STRING is
            replaced wholesale on a Hydra merge, so a cluster group and an
            experiment that both set it will not compose - the last one wins.
            Use ``srun_args`` for anything that needs to compose; keep this for
            flags that cannot be expressed as key/value.
        launcher_env_passthrough: Pass environment to launcher.
        env: Environment variables to set.
        srun_args: srun flags as a MAPPING, merged key-by-key by Hydra and
            rendered ahead of ``srun_opts``. See :class:`SrunConfig`.
        srun: LEGACY, NOT RENDERED. See :class:`SrunConfig`.
        sbatch: sbatch configuration.
        exclude_file: Optional path to a node-exclusion list. When set, the
            ``--exclude`` directive is resolved FROM THIS FILE AT RENDER TIME,
            overriding any ``sbatch.exclude`` baked in earlier. A restart
            re-renders the script but reuses the already-resolved config, so a
            node excluded after the first submission would otherwise never reach
            the resubmitted job. A missing or empty file leaves any existing
            ``sbatch.exclude`` untouched, so a bad path can never silently drop
            the exclusions.

            to ``sbatch`` instead).
